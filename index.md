दुतावास (Dutawas) is a community-powered platform dedicated to solving the information gap faced by Nepali citizens related to Embassary of Nepal in the United States. 

For many Nepali in the United States, accessing reliable information about embassy services, procedures, and requirements has been a persistent challenge. Important information is often:
- Scattered across multiple websites
- Outdated or not regularly maintained
- Difficult to find when needed most
- Not available in a centralized, easily accessible format

## Our Solution

This platform serves as a comprehensive, community-maintained repository of information about the Embassy of Nepal in the USA. We aim to:
- Centralize all embassy-related information in one place
- Keep information current and accurate
- Provide clear, easy-to-understand documentation
- Make embassy services more accessible to the Nepali community
- Enable community members to contribute and help maintain the information
