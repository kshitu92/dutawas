For many Nepali in the United States, accessing reliable information about embassy services, procedures, and requirements has been a persistent challenge. Important information is often:
- Scattered across multiple websites
- Outdated or not regularly maintained
- Difficult to find when needed most
- Not available in a centralized, easily accessible format


This platform serves as a comprehensive, community-maintained repository of information about the Embassy of Nepal in the USA. We aim to:
- Centralize all embassy-related information in one place
- Keep information current and accurate
- Provide clear, easy-to-understand documentation
- Make embassy services more accessible to the Nepali community
- Enable community members to contribute and help maintain the information
